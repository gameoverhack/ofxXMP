Provides access to Adobe's XMP metadata standard as standalone or embedded data. Basically these are 'markers' that can be embedded in Quicktime, WAV, AIFF etc files - useful for transcriptions, marking points in movies and the like. See http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/ and http://www.adobe.com/devnet/xmp.html for more info on the standard.
